Places are limited to 35, so please discuss your interest with colleagues before registering. As a [LATN](https://www.atn.edu.au/) initiative, 14 of the 35 places have been reserved for LATN Libraries. Beyond that number, [CAUL](http://www.caul.edu.au/) Libraries will be allowed to nominate one person per Library (agreed by their University Librarian) on a first come, first served basis. 

# Cost

A registration fee of $500 will apply to CAUL registrants. LATN attendees are being funded by LATN and will have their registration fee waived. Catering will be provided for morning tea, lunch and afternoon tea.

Registrations and dietary requirements can be sent to [barbara{dot}parnaby{at}curtin{dot}edu{dot}au](mailto:barbara.parnaby@curtin.edu.au)
