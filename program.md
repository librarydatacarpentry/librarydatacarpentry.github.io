The program is subject to change, but is anticipated to be composed of the following:

* Creative engagement with data: an introduction to Data Science and digital scholars
* Critical thinking with Data: Asking the right questions - How can we evaluate the quality, reliability and utility of data?
* Cleaning and Exploring Data with Open Refine - Transform the data you have into the data you want
* Data Analysis - Start learning to code in the Python programming language, automate repetitive tasks using the Unix shell, and safely store code and data under version control in Git
* Data visualisation - Plan, design and critique visualisations (explore a range of techniques, technologies and methods) for scholarly analysis, communication and engagement using your data
