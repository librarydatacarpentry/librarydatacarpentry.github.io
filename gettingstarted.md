# What to bring

* A laptop.  If you plan to use a laptop supplied by your institution, please ensure you have the right to install software.
  * Have installed: [Open Refine](http://openrefine.org/)  
  * Have registerd: A [Google Account](https://accounts.google.com/signup)

# What to do in the meantime

* Produce a poster that describes the tools you use to get things done. [Follow the instructions here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FWPtfUX33FohkcUeyvg0ENcg2Iz999ITXXR_hXANICI/edit?usp=sharing "Poster instructions"). We'll print out these posters and display them when we break for tea. They'll help you get a sense of what other attendees are using in their day to day work. You'll probably find you have some things in common, but maybe you'll see something you haven't seen before, or are curious to find out more about. We can learn a lot from each other.
* Participate in the Australian National Data Service [23 (research data) Things](http://ands.org.au/partners-and-communities/23-research-data-things)
* Verify that you have a working [EDUROAM](https://www.eduroam.org/) profile on your devices. Guest wifi connections will be available as an alternative should you have any trouble.
