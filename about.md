Library data Carpentry is a three day workshop for self styled data librarians. It will be held at the University of Technology Sydney on July 12-14 2016. The event is being produced by the Libraries of the Australian Technology Network. 

# Methodology

Library data Carpentry emulates programs designed to familiarise Librarians with digital scholarship (British Library Internal Digital Scholarship Training Programme 2012-, Data scientist training for librarians (DST4L) 2013-, UK Library Carpentry Dr James Baker 2015, AU Library Carpentry Belinda Weaver ResBaz Brisbane February 2016, 23 Things:Libraries for Research Data 2015-). Classes will demonstrate how data is located, retrieved, presented, and interpreted, with a focus on hard skills like software based techniques for data extraction, analysis, and visualization. Training will be elementary in an effort to balance the expertise of those attending.

# Objectives

* Attendees will gain hands-on experience of data extraction, munging, analysis and visualisation.
* Explore the ways data can be collected, used and abused, to substantiate argument.
* Help data librarians become more comfortable interacting with researchers and their data.
* Identify the main areas of digital scholarship that can be explored and turned into new research support services and procedures.
* Foster peer on peer learning
* Develop computational thinking
