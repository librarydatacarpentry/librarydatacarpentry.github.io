# Context

Scholarship is changing. New kinds of research techniques are being made possible by an ever more enveloping digital research infrastructure. But working with software and data isn’t always easy. There’s a lot of it, and its utility is highly variable.

Academic research libraries are well positioned to help researchers adapt to the demands of digital scholarship. They have already provided leadership in the development of research data services, offering researchers and faculty advice about techniques, technologies and methods for the discovery, integration, application, and presentation of data, as well as the availability of institutional and secondary infrastructures to support its use. Academic Libraries have recognised the need to build capacity in this area so that they can extend existing research data services to suit the evolving needs of their communities.

The need for data and software related training has prompted new training initiatives aimed at improving librarians’ familiarity with digital scholarship and its contingent infrastructure.

# Methodology

The workshops will span three days, involving roughly 30 participants. The target audience will be those in data-librarian-like roles. The syllabus will focus on hard skills like software based techniques for data extraction, analysis, and visualization. Training will be elementary in an effort to balance the expertise of those attending.

The syllabus will emulate programs designed to familiarise Librarians with digital scholarship (British Library Internal Digital Scholarship Training Programme 2012-, Data scientist training for librarians (DST4L) 2013-, UK Library Carpentry Dr James Baker 2015, AU Library Carpentry Belinda Weaver ResBaz Brisbane February 2016, 23 Things:Libraries for Research Data 2015-). The classes will demonstrate how data is located, retrieved, presented, interpreted and pluralised.

# Objectives

* Attendees will gain hands-on experience of data extraction, munging, analysis and visualisation.
* Help data librarians become more comfortable interacting with researchers and their data.
* Identify the main areas of digital scholarship that can be explored and turned into new research support services and procedures.
* Foster peer on peer learning
* Develop computational thinking
* Explore the ways data can be collected, used and abused, to substantiate argument.
